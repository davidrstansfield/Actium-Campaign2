title: "Agrippa’s Movements: September 2, 31 BC – August 13, 29 BC"
---

This document outlines what is known and unknown about Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa’s movements between the Battle of Actium (September 2, 31 BC) and Octavian’s triumph in Rome (August 13, 29 BC). Due to limited primary sources, much of Agrippa’s activities are speculative. We aim to provide a clear, factual basis for scholars to contribute new evidence or interpretations, correcting ambiguities in secondary accounts (e.g., Britannica).

## Factual Assessment: Agrippa’s Movements Largely Unknown?

The historical record is sparse, with Cassius Dio providing the primary evidence. Below, we list known details, unknown or speculative aspects, and questions for further research.

### Known Details

1. **September 2, 31 BC: At Actium**
   - **Location**: Actium, Greece.
   - **Activity**: Led Octavian’s fleet to victory.
   - **Source**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51; Plutarch, *Life of Antony*.
   - **Reasoning**: Multiple sources confirm Agrippa’s role, ensuring high confidence.

2. **Late 31 BC: Sent to Italy**
   - **Location**: Italy (likely Rome or Brundisium).
   - **Activity**: Managed veterans, held authority over Octavian’s letters, received sphinx seal.
   - **Source**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51.
   - **Reasoning**: Dio’s specific account aligns with Agrippa’s role. Confidence is high for Italy, medium for exact location.

3. **Early 29 BC – August 29 BC: In Rome**
   - **Location**: Rome.
   - **Activity**: Conducted census, purged Senate, prepared triumph.
   - **Source**: Cassius Dio, *Roman History*, Book 51; Britannica.
   - **Reasoning**: Governance tasks and triumph preparations confirm presence. High confidence.

### Unknown or Speculative

1. **September 31 BC – August 30 BC: Exact Movements**
   - **Gap**: No details on Agrippa’s activities during the Egyptian campaign.
   - **Possibilities**: Likely in Italy managing logistics (e.g., fleet supplies for 40,000 troops). Brief trips to Brundisium plausible; Corinth, Judea, Syria unsupported.
   - **Questions**: Did Agrippa visit Greek ports? Are there unrecorded Eastern activities?

2. **Fleet Locations Post-Actium**
   - **Gap**: Unclear where Agrippa’s fleet was based.
   - **Possibilities**: Brundisium (Italy) or Leucas/Methone (Greece) likely; Corinth possible but speculative.
   - **Questions**: Are there archaeological records of fleet bases?

3. **Spain in 29 BC**
   - **Gap**: No evidence of Agrippa’s involvement in Cantabrian Wars (began 29 BC).
   - **Possibilities**: Minor role (e.g., planning) possible but unlikely due to Roman duties.
   - **Questions**: Are there Spanish inscriptions linking Agrippa to 29 BC?

4. **Other Regions (e.g., Judea, Syria, Illyricum)**
   - **Gap**: No evidence of Agrippa’s presence.
   - **Possibilities**: Logistical oversight of Syrian campaign plausible but speculative. Judea minor; Herod met Octavian in Rhodes (Josephus, *Jewish Antiquities* 15.187–201).
   - **Questions**: Are there regional sources mentioning Agrippa?
